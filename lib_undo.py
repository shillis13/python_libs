-----------

This module is a placeholder for implementing a transactional undo functionality 
for file operations in the context of a file management toolkit.

The key concept is to use a combination of context managers and decorators to 
track and reverse file operations (like renaming, moving, and deleting) as part 
of transactional blocks.

Features and Ideas:
-------------------

1. Transactional Undo with Context Manager
   - The context manager demarcates the start and end of a transactional block.
   - All file operations within this block are logged as part of a single transaction.
   - The undo operation reverses all actions in the most recent transaction.

2. Decorator for Logging Actions
   - A decorator is used to automatically log file operations along with the details necessary to undo them.
   - Each logged action includes the function called, its arguments, and any other relevant details.

3. Maintaining a Transaction Log
   - A log maintains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a list of actions.
   - This log is crucial for the undo functionality, tracking the sequence and details of all operations.

4. Implementing Undo Logic
   - The undo function reverses the actions of the most recent transaction.
   - Actions are undone in reverse order to maintain integrity.

5. Error Handling and User Feedback
   - Transactions should handle errors gracefully, with the option to roll back immediately if an error occurs.
   - Clear feedback should be provided to the user regarding the start, end, and status of transactions and undo operations.

6. Persistence (Optional)
   - Consideration for persisting the transaction log to a file for durability and across script executions.

Sample Pseudo-Code:
-------------------

# Sample decorator and context manager implementation

transactions = []

def undo_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        transactions[-1].append((func, args, kwargs))
        return result
    return wrapper

@contextmanager
def transactional_undo_context():
    transactions.append([])
    yield
    if not transactions[-1]:
        transactions.pop()

# Example usage
with transactional_undo_context():
    # File operations

def perform_undo():
    # Logic to undo the last transaction

Note:
-----
This module is currently a placeholder and will be developed and refined further
based on specific requirements and use cases.
